# ML - Repository containing all things Data Science.

This repository contains a number of different statistical modelling and machine learing projects. Below is a brief summary of the types of models applied within this repository:

- **Regression:**
  - **Linear Regression:**
    1. Applied a linear regression model to the feul consumption dataset. 
    2. Applied a linear regression model to the KBB Automobile dataset.
  - **Poisson Regression:**
    1. Applied a Poisson regression, Linear regression and Poisson generalised additive model (GAM) to the bike sharing dataset. 
    2. Applied a Poisson offset regression model to the smoking and lung cancer dataset.  
- **Clustering:**
  - Applied a k-means and hierarhical clustering algorithms to the Chicago crime dataset. Also created a visualisation of the crime rates in the City of Chicago based on the clustering results. 
- **Neural Network:**
  - **NN:**
    1. Small notebook which delves into the inner workings of a neural network model. The main aim of the notebook is to provide an easy understanding of how a neural network model operates. The neural network is applied to the MNIST dataset. 
  - **CNN**:
    1. Notebook detailing the implementation of the DecovNet (Deconvolutional Network) visualisation technique as defined initially by Zeiler and Fergus. This technique is applied to the MNIST dataset. 
- **RShiny:**
  - Created an RShiny application which allows easy user interaction with the Left ventricular hypertrophy Dataset. The application allows a user to examine summary statistics, marginal histograms, boxplots and density plots of the dataset. The user can also apply a linear, logistic or Poisson regression model to the dataset based on their exact requirements.
